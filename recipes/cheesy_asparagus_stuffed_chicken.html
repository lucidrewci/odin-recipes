        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Slice the chicken in half about 3/4 of the way. Open the chicken and pound each side to be about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
            <li>Stuff the chicken breasts each with 2 slices of cheese, and 3 asparagus stalks. Fold the chicken oven and secure it with toothpicks around the edges.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl combine the brown sugar, chili powder, paprika, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Rub generously on each side of the chicken.</li>
            <li>Add the olive oil to a medium-sized skillet and turn to medium-high. Add the chicken and sear on each side for 2-3 minutes. Cover the pan with foil and put it into the oven. Cook for about 15-20 minutes or until the chicken is cooked throughout.</li>

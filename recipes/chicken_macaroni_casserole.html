            <li>1 cup Gruyere cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>3/4 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Optional Spices</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 tsp paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp ground mustard</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Crispy Panko Topping</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Panko breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F and grease a 9x13 casserole dish.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the chicken and let cook for 5 minutes. Then, flip chicken and let cook for another 5 minutes. Chicken will be cooked through once it has reached 165°F. Move chicken to a medium mixing bowl and shred with 2 forks. Wash skillet.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Par-cook macaroni pasta for about 4-5 minutes, or half of package instructions. It should still be quite hard and very al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet, melt ¼ cup butter over medium heat until lightly foamy. Stir in garlic until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Then whisk in flour and let cook for 1-2 minutes, constantly stirring.</li>
            <li>Gradually pour in warm milk while whisking until smooth. Then repeat with the warm broth. Add ½ teaspoon salt and pepper each and let simmer over medium-high heat for 8-12 minutes, stirring often. The sauce should be able to coat the back of a spoon at this point.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat. Add the cheddar, Gruyere, and mozzarella cheeses along with the spices if you're using them. Stir to melt the cheese, then add the pasta, chicken, and habenero. Mix thoroughly and season to taste. Transfer the whole mixture to the casserole dish.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoon melted butter, Panko breadcrumbs, and Parmesan cheese. Stir to combine. Sprinkle evenly over the macaroni and cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15-20 minutes until golden and bubbly. Then broil for an additional 3-5 minutes but make sure to keep an eye on it. Let cool slightly before serving.</li>
        </ol>
